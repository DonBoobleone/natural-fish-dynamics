# Natural Fish Dynamics - A Mod for Factorio

Fish breed on their own in their natural habitat.
On supported planets chunks can spawn fish if:
- There is at least 2 Fish
- There is enough water.

Fish will reproduce based on a normal distribution.
Highest chance of reproduction when water is half-full with fish.

Fish to water ratio (default: 4 water-tile / fish) and breeding cycle can be fine tuned in the settings.

## Supported Planets
