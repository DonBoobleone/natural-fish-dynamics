# Natural Fish Dynamics - A Mod for Factorio

Fish breed on their own in their natural habitat.
On supported planets chunks can spawn fish if:
- There is at least 2 Fish
- There is enough water.

Fish will reproduce based on a normal distribution.
Highest chance of reproduction when water is half-full with fish.

Fish to water ratio (default: 4 water-tile / fish) and breeding cycle can be fine tuned in the settings.

## Supported Planets
- Nauvis
- Gleba - Check tips how to import fish on Gleba
- Aquilo - Fish import is also needed (Note: Won't work with mods that void items in ammonia ocean)
- Pelagos
- Lignumis
- Rabbasca

## Settings

All settings are runtime-global and can be changed in-game at any time.

- **Breeding Limit** – Maximum fish per chunk before overpopulation stops breeding (default 256, 16–512).
- **Breeding Cycle** – How frequently breeding attempts occur (default "normal"; options from "fast (×2)" to "ultra-slow (÷10)").
- **Enable Breeding on [Planet]** – One toggle per planet (Nauvis, Gleba, Aquilo, Pelagos, Lignumis, Rabbasca). All default to enabled.

Disabling breeding on a planet you don't plan to use fish on skips all breeding checks for that planet, saving UPS with no side effects.

## Tip
You can catch and release fish by dropping them in water with 'Z'
